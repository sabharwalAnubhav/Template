Pre-requisites to run CloudFormation template :

1. Create a key pair for the hosted region and add the key pair name in the template.
   Step to add a new key pair:
   Go to Management console-> Click on EC2-> Click on key Pair on the left side bar under Network and Security-> Create new key pair
2. Find out the AMI id to launch an instance and add in the template. AMI Idâ€™s are specific to regions.
    Go to Management console-> Click on EC2-> Click on Launch Instance-> Copy AMI ID
3. AWS CLI must be installed on your machine to launch Stack.   
4. To launch CloudFormation Stack use the following command:
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name StackName --template-body file://$PWD/yourFileName.yml  --profile yourProfileName 
    
    
    Note: profileName can be create via aws configure --profile yourProfileName
    
 5. After launch of CloudFormation Template.
    SSH to the EC2 instance and run docker container using below command
    
    
    -> docker start -a containerID or docker attach containerID or docker exec -it containerID /bin/bash  
    -> run the python script available at /tmp/udpclient.py to send message to server.


We can make this process more efficient by adding other tools while provisioning like Ansible.The scripts for parsing the data can be created in more customized.I'm stuck for getting containerId and timestamp in message output however, I have found the way to get it and will be done soon.
